# Support

Have questions, need support and/or just want to talk?

Use one of the following resources for general questions, support requests or issues with your own code:

- Ask on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/n2x-io/discussions).
- Use the `#general`, `#support` or `#developers` channels on our [Discord](https://n2x.io/discord) chat.

For long term discussion or larger issues, [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/n2x-io/discussions) are the preferred channel.

Please don't use the issue tracker for support questions. The issue tracker is a tool to address bugs and feature requests.
